# Style Tile Template

A basic template for creating style tiles using HTML and CSS instead of Photoshop. The intent is to bring on-screen styling into the process as early as possible in order to save on production time later on.

Inspired by [Samantha Warren] (https://twitter.com/SamanthaToy), initial creator of the [Style Tile] (http://www.styletil.es) concept.
