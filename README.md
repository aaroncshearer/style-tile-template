# Style Tile Template

A basic template for creating style tiles using HTML and CSS instead of Photoshop. The intent is to bring on-screen styling into the process as early as possible in order to save on production time later on.

Created using SASS and Compass. Not required, but highly recommended (if you're not using a preprocessor, why not?).

Inspired by [Samantha Warren] (https://twitter.com/SamanthaToy), initial creator of the [Style Tile] (http://www.styletil.es) concept.
